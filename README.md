# Virtual Data Science Internship - British Airways (through Forage)
---

Welcome to the repository documenting my virtual internship experience with Forage, a platform offering Virtual Work Experiences endorsed by leading companies. These programs are designed to simulate real-world work scenarios, providing valuable insights and practical skills to students eager to kickstart their careers. 

During my winter break, I seized the opportunity to engage in this Virtual Data Science Internship with British Airways, aiming to test and enhance my skills while gaining hands-on experience with real-life datasets. There were two tasks provided in this internship:

### Task 1: Customer Review Data Analysis

In this phase, I leveraged web scraping techniques with Beautiful Soup and Natural Language Processing to extract insights from textual customer reviews. Employing advanced techniques such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and word clouds, I added layers of depth to my data analysis and visualization, transforming raw feedback into meaningful inisghts.

### Task 2: Predictive Modeling for Customer Buying Behavior

The second task involved predicting customer buying behavior. I implemented machine learning algorithms using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn, to construct predictive models and identify the important features in influencing customer behaviour. The results were seamlessly visualized through tools such as Python and Tableau.

I extend my gratitude to Forage for providing students like me with opportunities to apply and refine our skills in a practical setting. This internship has been a valuable experience, allowing me to grow as a data scientist. Thank you, Forage, for this enriching opportunity!
