# Virtual Data Science Internship - British Airways (through Forage)
---

Welcome to the repository documenting my virtual internship experience with Forage, a platform offering Virtual Work Experience Programs endorsed by leading companies. These programs are designed to simulate real-world work scenarios, providing valuable insights and practical skills to students eager to kickstart their careers. 

During my winter break, I seized the opportunity to engage in this Virtual Data Science Internship with British Airways, aiming to test and enhance my skills while gaining hands-on experience with real-life datasets. There were two tasks provided in this internship:

1) Task 1: Web scraping to gain insights on customer review data - I employed techniques like Data Scraping and Natural Language Processing. Since the reviews were all textual data, I did some topic modeling, sentiment analysis and word clouds to add depth to my data analysis and visualization. 
   
3) Task 2: Predicting customer buying behaviour - I delved into web scraping using Beautiful Soup and implemented machine learning algorithms using Python libraries including pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn to construct predictive models. The visualization of results was achieved through tools like Python and Tableau, demonstrating my proficiency in data analysis and visualization.

I extend my gratitude to Forage for providing students like me with opportunities to apply and refine our skills in a practical setting. This internship has been a valuable experience, allowing me to grow as a data scientist. Thank you, Forage, for this enriching opportunity!
